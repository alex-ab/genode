The 'black_hole' component provides dummy implementations of common
session interfaces.

At this time, the following sessions are provided if enabled
in the configuration of the component:

* Audio_in
* Audio_out
* Capture
* Event
* Nic
* Uplink
* ROM
* Gpu
* Usb

<config>
	<audio_in/>
	<audio_out/>
	<capture/>
	<event/>
	<nic/>
	<uplink/>
	<rom/>
	<gpu/>
	<usb/>
</config>

Be aware, that the USB service is merely announced but always throws a
Service_denied exception when trying to request a session. This is considered
a temporary solution.
